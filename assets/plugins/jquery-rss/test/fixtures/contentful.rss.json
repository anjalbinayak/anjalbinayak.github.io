On Oct. 24–25, the Ada Lovelace Festival will celebrate her contributions and those of women leading tech today with talks, workshops and social activities.\n\nThis year’s event focuses on the topic of ownership. Speakers from leading enterprises — such as Volkswagen, Accenture and SAP — will engage with artists, activists and government officials to discuss who gets to own the future of the digital world, and how more people can be involved.\n\nI’m thrilled to attend this year. Here are a few reasons why.\n",
